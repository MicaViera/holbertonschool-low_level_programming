## C - Singly Linked Lists

# Description

On this repository I'm starting with a new project about singly linked lists.

# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, 
without the help of Google:
General.
* When and why using linked lists vs arrays
* How to build and use linked lists.

# Tasks

0. Print list: Write a function that prints all the elements of a *list_t* list.
1. List length: Write a function that returns the number of elements in a 
linked *list_t* list.
2. Add node: Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a 
*list_t* list.
3. Add node at the end: Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a
*list_t* list.
4. Free list: Write a function that frees a *list_t* list.
